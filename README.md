# **PegaDevTools**

PDT is browser-only (i.e. no ruleset deployment is required) Pega 8 developer productivity tool.

First, check out the feature list in the [PDT Wiki](https://github.com/marcin-l/PegaDevTools/wiki).

Extension development is mostly targeting chromium-based browsers, but it should for the most part work in Firefox.
